CS 1030-003 Final Project

Step 2: Hypothesis Question
  If people choose between multiple common types of candy given out on Halloween, which candy will rank the highest?
  I hypthesize that Reese's will be the most liked candy, based on past experience and high inclusion rates in combo packs    sold during the Halloween season. 


Step 4: Proccess & Results of Analysis

  Data derived from:
  https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/
  
Original data was pulled from a response pool of 250,000 users choosing their preferred candy between 2/86 possible choices, and then compiling this data to determine a favorite.
This data was then run through a series of possible reasonings to determine if there was a logical reasoning as to why some candies came out with higher preferences than others.
